Pod was a popular iOS calendar app for iOS that I built with [Justin Krause](https://justinkrause.biz) from 2016â€“2018.

In 2019 it was acquired and rebranded as [Calendar](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calendar/id1113106806?mt=8).

Pod was used by 20 thousand people per month and was featured 5+ times on the App Store.

We raised $1M in funding from [Harrison Metal](https://www.harrisonmetal.com) and launched relationship management, teamwork, and scheduling features that are unique among calendars.
