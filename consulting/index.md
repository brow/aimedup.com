I design and build software that interfaces directly with people. For the last 10 years, I've focused on native iOS applications.

I've focused especially on building applications that interact with a complex data graph over the network and remain functional offline. Most recently I built the calendar [Pod](https://pod.io) and led iOS development on [Asana][asana-ios].

I've usually worked in a startup environment. I'm comfortable working with dedicated designers and PMs, and also with performing those roles myself. I'm accustomed to building products around changing and breaking APIs.

I can help with hard problems in performance, stability, networking, persistence, concurrency, and security. I was an early adopter of Swift and ReactiveSwift, and I enjoy mentoring engineers who are learning those paradigms.

As a startup founder, I'm also accustomed to working throughout the technical stack and solving business problems in a variety of ways.

I'm experienced with both remote and colocated work. In both environments, I value thoughtful communication and emotional intelligence.
