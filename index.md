# Rebecca Butler

I design and build software for human use. For the last 10 years, I've focused on native iOS apps.

I'm sometimes available for [consulting](/consulting).

Previously I led iOS development at [Asana](https://asana.com), then cofounded [Pod](/pod).

Longer ago I worked at Google and Lytro, and consulted for startups funded by Y Combinator, Harrison Metal, and Accel Partners.

Longer ago yet I studied computer science at [Stanford](https://cs.stanford.edu/). My full CV is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tombrow/).
