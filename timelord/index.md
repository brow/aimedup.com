Set timers on your iPhone without touching or unlocking it. Just ask Siri.

Timelord is designed for sticky-fingered cooks without a free hand: 

* Set timers and check their progress just by asking Siri
* Run as many different timers at once as you like
* No need to unlock your phone or switch away from the recipe you're looking at

In fact, Timelord is great for any hands-on activity when you need to keep track of multiple timers.

Because it's integrated into Siri, it works great with AirPods or with your phone sitting on the counter, and you can listen to music or podcasts while using it.

Timelord is **coming soon** to the iOS App Store.
