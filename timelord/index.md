Set timers on your iPhone without touching or unlocking it. Just ask Siri.

Timelord is designed for sticky-fingered cooks without a free hand: 

* Set timers and check their progress by asking Siri
* Run several different timers at once
* No need to unlock your phone, or switch away from the recipe or video you're looking at

In fact, Timelord is great for any hands-on activity when you need to keep track of multiple timers.

It works great with AirPods or with your phone sitting on the counter, and you can listen to music or podcasts while using it.

Timelord is **coming soon** to the iOS App Store.
