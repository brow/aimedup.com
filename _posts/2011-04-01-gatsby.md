[Gatsby] was a mobile service that would instigate spontaneous meetings between
nearby people with similar interests. 

I built a native iOS app for Gatsby. My working prototype was much improved by
[Sara Thacher], Will Tsui, and [Gabe Smedresman], and later published on the App
Store. The prototype's features included:

* Foursquare and Facebook authorization via OAuth

Gatsby shut down in 2012. More screenshots are available on [Gabe's Gatsby page].
