[Gatsby] was a mobile service that instigated spontaneous meetings between
nearby people with similar interests. 

I created a native iOS client for Gatsby. My working prototype was ably built
upon by [Sara Thacher], Will Tsui, and [Gabe Smedresman], and later published on
the App Store.

The prototype integrates with a private RESTful API and authorizes itself with
Facebook and Foursquare using OAuth 2.0.

Gatsby shut down in 2012. More screenshots are available on [Gabe's site].
