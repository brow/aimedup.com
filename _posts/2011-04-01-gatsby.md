[Gatsby] was a mobile service that instigated spontaneous meetings between
nearby people with similar interests. 

I built a native iOS app for Gatsby. My working prototype was much improved by
[Sara Thacher], Will Tsui, and [Gabe Smedresman], and later published on the App
Store.

The prototype integrates with a private RESTful API as well as those of Foursquare and
Facebook. It implements authorization via OAuth 2.0.

Gatsby shut down in 2012. More screenshots are available on [Gabe's site].
