[iEFS] is an iOS web browser that gives patent attorneys mobile access to the
government portal they use to file and track patent applications. 

The portal is normally unusable from iOS devices because it authenticates
users through a Java applet, and because Mobile Safari does not support file
uploads.

iEFS integrates with a private backend, which performs login using a
Java-enabled browser on cluster of EC2 instances.

The app simulates file upload support in a standard web view by injecting
JavaScript and CSS. The upload request is constructed in native code and is
capable of streaming an arbitrarily large file from disk.
