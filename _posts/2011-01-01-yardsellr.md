[Yardsellr] was a web-based marketplace with deep social integration.

Yardsellr for iPhone was a native mobile interface to Yardsellr that I designed and
developed as a contractor in collaboration with the company. Its features
included:

* Universal search with autocompletion
* Custom collection views optimized for browsing
* Streamlined flow for photographing an item and posting it for sale
* Payment via Braintree and PayPal client-side APIs
* Facebook integration, including Like buttons via [FacebookLikeView]
